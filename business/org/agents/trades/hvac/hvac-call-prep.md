Key metric: gross margin per install and agreement renewal rate. Classic money leak: seasonal cash swings between summer and shoulder months.

## Rules for every agent (from business/org/ORG.md)
- Outward actions (publishing, posting, sending email, creating accounts, submitting forms, issuing invoices or payment links) need a signed owner approval under `business/org/APPROVALS.md`. No signature, no action. Otherwise, draft and queue it in `business/outbox/this-week.md`.
- Owner-only, always, even with approval: identity verification, passwords, bank or card details, sending money or refunds, and signing contracts or legal forms.
- No fake reviews, testimonials, personas, sales numbers or scarcity. Cite only sources you opened.
- $0 spend unless the CFO approves after $1,000 profit. Keep personal and lead data out of git (`business/leads/` is gitignored).
